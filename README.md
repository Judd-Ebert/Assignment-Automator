# Assignment Automator

Takes in assignments from an iCal link, filters through to get the assignemts(based on Blackbaud's information), and sends it to a notion database.

Not too much to say about the project other than hopefully it will help me do my assignments quicker. I'm using it to help me differentiate between classes and assignments in Notion Calendar. Feel free to improve it and use it for anything you'd like!

- Note: The Python SDK I'm using doesn't have "query" for notion databases for some reason, so I have to use HTTP for those requests.
